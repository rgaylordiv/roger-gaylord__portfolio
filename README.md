# Welcome To My Portfolio!

Thank you for checking out my potfolio! I tried to use a good mixture of what I've learned (front end wise) along with some new cool tools to give it some flare. Included are my main projects that I have spent probably hundereds of hours on.

## Packages Used

-[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simple-typewriter]This is the typewriter effect I used on the main portion.

-[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt]All of the images have a "tilt" effect that allows the user to move around the images to change the perspective of it!

-[https://www.npmjs.com/package/cobe]My favorite overall was definitly Cobe. This is the globe that is diplayed beside the typewriter effect. Not only is it visually appealing, but every time I loaded up my dev build I would take a second to awe at it. It's truly special.
