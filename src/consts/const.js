  "I was born in the beautiful city of Folsom, California, the perfect distance from the snow and the beach. Growing up I was obsessed with doing ever sport that I could get my hands on, eventually landing on soccer. I managed to play at a competitive level for quite a number of years. During my free time, I would be gaming. Computers had always seemed so mysterious to me, and the idea of being able to create and understand the programs and languages was and has been a huge interest of mine. I graduated high school and made my way out to Montana for college where I studied Business-Management. While living there, I got enveloped in the rock climbing culture. I would find myself after class or work pouring my blood sweat and tears on the rocks. I was in love with it. The feeling of figuring out how to properly complete a climb at a level you don’t think was feasible is a high like no other. This is the same feeling I have towards programming. Going from starting a project not knowing at all what to do or where to start to finishing it and being proud to say that I created it myself is one of the most overwhelmingly joyous feelings I’ve experienced. I have had plenty of jobs, ranging from ice cream scooper to an axe throwing instructor, however, my most prestigious  one was my role at ADT/Everon. I worked as a Junior National Account Manager under one of the most successful National Account Managers in our region. There, I collaborated and worked with many national companies like USLBM, Sweetgreen, 99 Cents Only, etc. to help provide them exceptional security service. My position mainly consisted of helping design and survey security and  fire systems while connecting with the clients themselves to make sure we achieve what they need. Learning how to code has been one of the most exciting yet terrifying things I have experienced. Everyday being able to learn new methods and ways to navigate this world has made me realize that this is what I want to do with my life. ";
