  "I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Folsom, California. My interests are rock climbing, programming, and gaming. In my previous role I worked as a Junior National Account manager for ADT/Everon under the top sales representative in the area. There, I collaborated with many national companies such as USLBM, GOPUFF, iStorage, Quick Quack Car Wash, etc. My job was to survey the locations and with the help of multiple teams design the security, fire, and camera systems for each location. A big task of mine was to personally meet with the clients and guide them through every step and make sure they were being provided the quality they deserved. Since then, I enrolled in TripleTen, a Full Stack Engineering bootcamp. While being there I developed multiple projects that I am proud to share. With all the knowledge I have gained and continue to build upon, I strive to only bring the upmost of quality with all of my endeavors.";
